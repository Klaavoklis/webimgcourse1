                <h2>Chapter 1: Welcome to the Future of Creativity</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the Al Content Creator Academy, and congratulations on taking your first step into the world of generative Al.</p>
                <p>In this course, I'll guide you through everything you need to start creating stunning visuals using Al, even if you've never touched these tools before. By the end, you'll understand the fundamentals of image generation, know which platforms to use, and be able to bring your creative ideas to life with just a few words.</p>
                
                <h3>What Is Generative Al?</h3>
                <p>Imagine sitting next to an infinitely skilled artist, someone who can paint, photograph, or design anything you describe, instantly. That's essentially what generative Al is. You describe an idea, and the Al interprets it into a visual form.</p>
                <p>It's like having a creative partner who never sleeps, never runs out of inspiration, and can explore every artistic direction you can imagine.</p>

                <h3>Why This Technology Excites Me</h3>
                <p>When I first discovered Al image generation, I was amazed by how quickly it unlocked new ways to express creativity. What once required years of artistic training or expensive tools could now be done in minutes, powered only by imagination and curiosity.</p>
                <p>Over time, I've learned that mastering Al content creation isn't about knowing every setting or model. It's about learning to think visually, describe ideas clearly, and experiment fearlessly.</p>
                <p>That's exactly what the Al Content Creator Academy is built to help you do.</p>
                <h3>What You'll Learn</h3>
                <p>Over the next few chapters, I'll walk you through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The essential concepts every Al creator needs to know.</li>
                    <li>How to write prompts that produce professional-quality results.</li>
                    <li>The tools and platforms you can use, from easy all-in-one options like Higgsfield to more advanced tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Sora.</li>
                    <li>A simple workflow for creating your first masterpiece from start to finish.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Before We Begin</h3>
                <p>Don't worry if some of this feels new or intimidating. You don't need to be an artist, designer, or coder. All you need is curiosity and a willingness to experiment.</p>
                <p>By the time you finish this course, you'll have not only the knowledge but also the confidence to call yourself an Al content creator, ready to create, share, and collaborate inside our growing Whop community.</p>
                <p>Let's dive in. Next, we'll cover the absolute essentials that every Al creator should understand before generating their first image.</p>
            `,
            2: `
                <h2>Chapter 2: The Absolute Essentials (Core Concepts)</h2>
                <p>Before we start generating, it's important to understand the building blocks behind Al image creation. These core concepts: models, prompts, and parameters, are the foundation of everything you'll do as an Al content creator.</p>
                <p>In this chapter, I'll keep things simple and practical, focusing only on what truly matters for beginners.</p>

                <h3>1. Models - The Creative Engines Behind the Magic</h3>
                <p>When you hear someone mention Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or Sora, they're talking about models. A model is like the engine of a car; it's what actually powers the generation process. Each one has its own personality, style, and strengths.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Higgsfield.ai</b> - My top pick for beginners. It's an all-in-one platform that handles both image and video generation beautifully.</li>
                    <li><b>Midjourney</b> - Known for its artistic, cinematic results. Works through Discord, so it's great if you enjoy community-driven creation.</li>
                    <li><b>Stable Diffusion</b> - Fully open-source and extremely flexible. You can customize it endlessly, but it requires more setup.</li>
                    <li><b>Sora</b> - Integrated directly into ChatGPT, making it the most intuitive for natural language users.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Think of each model as a different art studio. Part of your creative growth will be discovering which one fits your vision best.</p>

                <h3>2. Prompts - The Language of Creation</h3>
                <p>If models are the engines, prompts are the steering wheel. A prompt is simply the text you write to describe what you want the Al to create. This is the single most important skill you'll learn in this course. A strong prompt can turn an average image into something breathtaking.</p>

                <h3>3. Parameters - Fine-Tuning the Details</h3>
                <p>Parameters are like the settings on a camera. They don't change what you're photographing; they change how it looks. Here are the key ones to know:</p>
                <p><b>Aspect Ratio (--ar)</b> - Controls the shape of your image.</p>
                <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 items-start">
                    <figure class="flex-1 min-w-[200px]"><img src="https://github.com/Klaavoklis/course-assets/raw/main/1.1ratio.png" alt="1:1 Aspect Ratio"><figcaption class="text-center text-gray-400 mt-2">--ar 1:1 (Square)</figcaption></figure>
                    <figure class="flex-1 min-w-[200px]"><img src="https://github.com/Klaavoklis/course-assets/raw/main/3.2ratio.png" alt="3:2 Aspect Ratio"><figcaption class="text-center text-gray-400 mt-2">--ar 3:2 (Wide)</figcaption></figure>
                    <figure class="flex-1 min-w-[200px]"><img src="https://github.com/Klaavoklis/course-assets/raw/main/2.3ratio.png" alt="2:3 Aspect Ratio"><figcaption class="text-center text-gray-400 mt-2">--ar 2:3 (Vertical)</figcaption></figure>
                </div>
                <p><b>Stylization (--stylize or "guidance scale")</b> - Adjusts how creative or realistic the output is. Lower values are more accurate to your prompt, while higher values allow for more artistic interpretation.</p>
                <p><b>Negative Prompts (--no)</b> - Tell the Al what to avoid in the image.</p>
                <p>These parameters are your creative dials. Once you learn to control them, you'll have complete control over your output.</p>
            `,
            3: `
                <h2>Chapter 3: The Art of the Perfect Prompt</h2>
                <p>Great prompting is what separates casual users from true creators. In this chapter, I'll teach you a simple, repeatable system I personally use for every image I create: the <b>Subject - Setting - Style</b> formula.</p>
                
                <h3>The Formula: Subject - Setting - Style</h3>
                <p>Think of your prompt as telling a short, visual story. You're giving the Al three key pieces of information:</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><b>Subject:</b> What or who is the focus of the image.</li>
                    <li><b>Setting:</b> Where the scene takes place.</li>
                    <li><b>Style:</b> How it should look and feel.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Subject: Be Specific</h3>
                <p>Avoid general descriptions. Instead, give details that spark a clear image.</p>
                <div class="prompt-box"><button class="copy-btn">Copy</button><code>a dog</code></div>
                <img src="https://github.com/Klaavoklis/course-assets/raw/main/adog.png" alt="Image of a generic dog">
                <div class="prompt-box"><button class="copy-btn">Copy</button><code>a golden retriever puppy with soft fur</code></div>
                <img src="https://github.com/Klaavoklis/imageassets/raw/main/goldenpuppy.png" alt="Image of a golden retriever puppy">

                <h3>Setting: Build the World</h3>
                <p>Next, tell the Al where the subject is. Even a simple background adds depth and meaning.</p>

                <h3>Style: Bring It to Life</h3>
                <p>This is where the real magic happens. Style controls the artistic direction. Here are three main categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Artistic Style:</b> "impressionist painting," "cyberpunk," "anime," "art deco," "digital illustration."</li>
                    <li><b>Camera & Film:</b> "cinematic," "35mm film," "shot on Kodak Portra 400," "macro photography."</li>
                    <li><b>Lighting:</b> "dramatic lighting," "soft morning light," "golden hour," "studio lighting."</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
                <p>Here's how the formula looks in action:</p>
                <div class="prompt-box"><button class="copy-btn">Copy</button><code>photo of a golden retriever puppy (Subject) sitting in a sun-drenched meadow filled with wildflowers (Setting), cinematic, warm golden hour lighting, shot on a 50mm lens (Style) --ar 3:2</code></div>

                <h2>Chapter 4: Your Creative Toolkit - A Tour of the Platforms</h2>
                <p>Now that you understand how to write strong prompts, it's time to choose where to use them. Each Al image platform has its own strengths and creative personality.</p>

                <h3>1. Midjourney - The King of Quality and Style</h3>
                <p>Best for: Artistic, cinematic, and high-end results. Midjourney runs directly through Discord, which makes it community-driven and highly interactive. It excels at producing visually stunning, stylized results.</p>
                <img src="https://github.com/Klaavoklis/course-assets/raw/main/misjourneyui.png" alt="Midjourney UI">

                <h3>2. Stable Diffusion - The Power User's Playground</h3>
                <p>Best for: Customization and experimentation. Stable Diffusion is open-source, which means you can download and modify it freely. If you love tinkering, Stable Diffusion is a dream come true.</p>
                <img src="https://github.com/Klaavoklis/course-assets/raw/main/stableui.png" alt="Stable Diffusion UI">

                <h3>3. Higgsfield.ai - The All-in-One Powerhouse</h3>
                <p>Best for: Beginners who want both image and video creation in one place. It combines multiple generative models into a single, clean interface, making experimentation fast and fun.</p>
                <img src="https://github.com/Klaavoklis/course-assets/raw/main/higgsfieldui.png" alt="Higgsfield.ai UI">

                <h3>My Personal Recommendation</h3>
                <p>If you're completely new to Al content creation, start with Higgsfield.ai. It gives you the most complete toolkit with the least setup so you can focus on learning prompts and exploring your creativity without worrying about technical details.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 5: Your First Masterpiece - A Simple Workflow</h2>
                <p>It's time to put everything you've learned into practice. I'll walk you step-by-step through the exact process I use to turn an idea into a finished, high-quality image.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 1: The Idea</h3>
                <p>Every great image starts with a simple concept. Don't overthink it. Try starting with something like: "A cat sitting on a pile of books in a cozy library."</p>

                <h3>Step 2: The First Prompt</h3>
                <p>Now, turn your idea into a structured prompt using the <b>Subject - Setting - Style</b> formula.</p>
                <div class="prompt-box"><button class="copy-btn">Copy</button><code>photo of a cat (Subject) sitting on a pile of books in a cozy library with warm sunlight streaming through the window (Setting), cinematic, soft golden hour lighting, shot on a 50mm lens (Style) --ar 3:2</code></div>
                <img src="https://github.com/Klaavoklis/course-assets/raw/main/catbooks.png" alt="Cat on a pile of books">

                <h3>Step 3: Generating and Refining</h3>
                <p>Look carefully at the images the Al gives you. Pick the one that feels closest to what you envisioned. Now you have options: upscale it for higher detail or create variations. Al image generation is iterative. Each new attempt teaches you something.</p>

                <h3>Step 4: Upscaling</h3>
                <p>Upscaling is simply enhancing the quality and resolution of your chosen image. Think of it like polishing a photograph. Every major platform has a built-in upscaler that instantly improves resolution.</p>
                <img src="https://github.com/Klaavoklis/course-assets/raw/main/upscale.png" alt="Upscaling process example">
                
                <h3>Step 5 (Optional): The Finishing Touches</h3>
                <p>If you want to take your image even further, you can use external tools like Magnific.ai for detail enhancement or Photoshop for final composition.</p>
